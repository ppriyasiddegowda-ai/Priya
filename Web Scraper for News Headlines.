1. What is a GET request?

A GET request is an HTTP request used to retrieve data from a server.
In Python (with requests), it looks like:

response = requests.get("https://example.com")

It asks the website to send back the web page or data.




2. How do you install external packages in Python?

You use the pip command in your terminal or command prompt.
For example:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4




3. What is a User-Agent in HTTP?

A User-Agent is a string that tells the server who is making the request — for example, a browser, a bot, or a script.

headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}

Some websites block requests without a valid User-Agent.




4. What is soup.find_all() used for?

In BeautifulSoup, soup.find_all() is used to find all HTML elements that match a specific tag or condition.

soup.find_all('h3')  # Finds all <h3> tags




5. What are the risks of web scraping?

Legal risks (violating terms of service)

IP blocking by the website

Site structure changes breaking your code

Data inaccuracy

Heavy load on websites if not throttled





6. What’s the difference between id and class in HTML?

Attribute	Purpose	Unique?

id	Identifies one unique element	✅ Yes
class	Groups similar elements	❌ No (can repeat)


Example:

<div id="header"></div>
<div class="news-item"></div>




7. What is an HTML tag?

An HTML tag is a piece of code that defines the structure of a web page. Example:

<h1>Headline</h1>

<h1> is a tag for a main heading. Tags often come in opening and closing pairs.




8. What does .text return in BeautifulSoup?

.text returns only the text content inside an HTML tag, with all HTML code removed.

tag = soup.find('h3')
print(tag.text)  # Just the visible text




9. What is a try-except block?

A try-except block is used to handle errors in Python safely.

try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")




10. What are HTTP status codes?

They indicate the result of an HTTP request.

Code	Meaning

200	OK (Success)
404	Not Found
403	Forbidden
500	Server Error
301	Moved Permanently


Use .status_code in Python:

response = requests.get(url)
print(response.status_code)
