1. What is a template in Flask?
A template is an HTML file (often with placeholders) used to display dynamic content in Flask. It lets you separate your design (HTML/CSS) from your Python code. Templates live in the templates/ folder by default.




2. What’s Jinja2?
Jinja2 is the template engine Flask uses. It allows you to put variables and logic inside your HTML using {{ ... }} for variables and {% ... %} for statements (like loops or if conditions).




3. How do you pass data to a template?
You pass data by including variables in render_template():

from flask import render_template
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html", name="Priya")

In index.html:

<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>




4. How are forms handled in Flask?

You create an HTML <form> in a template.

You set method="POST" or GET".

In Flask, you use request.form (for POST) or request.args (for GET) to get the data.


from flask import request
@app.route("/submit", methods=["POST"])
def submit():
    username = request.form["username"]
    return f"Hello, {username}"




5. What is render_template()?
It’s a Flask function that loads an HTML file from the templates folder and replaces placeholders with the data you pass in.




6. How to style your app?
You put CSS files inside the static/ folder and link them in your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">




7. What’s POST vs GET method in forms?

GET: Sends data in the URL (e.g., search queries).

POST: Sends data in the request body (more secure for sensitive info).





8. What are static files?
Files like CSS, JavaScript, images, videos that don’t change dynamically. Flask serves them from the static/ folder.




9. How is routing done in Flask?
Routing is done with @app.route("URL") above a function.
Example:

@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return "About Page"



10. Can Flask serve HTML/CSS/JS?
Yes — HTML goes in templates, CSS/JS/images go in the static folder, and Flask serves them automatically using url_for().
